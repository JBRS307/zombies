# Zombie shooter
Game was done as a part of 2023 Introduction to Web Applications course on AGH university.

It's a very simple shooter with difficulty increasing over time (more small zombies which move faster).

Game is not meant to be played on screens smaller than 1440x900 and will not load.

Playable [here](https://jbrs307.github.io/zombies/).
